# multibot: the bot computer WITHOUT Docker.
#
# Same desktop, same interface, no container: an X server, a window manager, a
# Chromium with CDP, and websockify serving noVNC — on exactly the ports the
# container publishes (cdp 9223, novnc 6901), so the harness proxy and
# engine/server/computer.py work against either backend unchanged.
#
# This exists for hosts where Docker cannot run at all. The obvious one is
# Termux on Android: Docker needs kernel privileges an unrooted phone will
# never grant, so the container path is not "hard" there, it is impossible.
#
# SECURITY, and this is the real difference from the container: there is NO
# isolation here. The browser and `computer_exec` run as your own user, on your
# own machine, with your own files — including MultiBot's own data directory and
# API keys. The container backend confines an agent to a throwaway filesystem;
# this one does not. Prefer Docker wherever it exists.
