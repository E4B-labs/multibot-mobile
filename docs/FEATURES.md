# MultiBot feature map

MultiBot is a self-hosted workspace for a fleet of named AI bots. The React
client, authenticated Node harness, and Python agent runtime ship as one
product. The old OpenMausBot name remains only in migration paths and internal
data directories so existing installations keep working.

## What is available

| Area | Current behavior | Main code |
|---|---|---|
| Bot roster | Create, rename, duplicate, pin, hide, delete, search, unread state, per-bot persona and icon shape | `src/components/Sidebar.tsx`, `src/components/SettingsPanel.tsx` |
| Provider picker | Claude Code, Codex, Grok, Gemini, Kimi Code, Qwen Code, computer agent, and named custom models; a custom model accepts API key, base URL, and model id | `src/components/ModelPicker.tsx`, `server/config.ts` |
| Custom models | Stored in the local config; keys are write-only in API responses; built-in CLI entries remain when custom entries are added | `server/index.ts`, `server/drivers/slafy.ts` |
| Chat runtime | Streaming replies, tool activity, interruptions, approvals, questions, files, screenshots, transcript persistence | `server/index.ts`, `server/harness/`, `src/components/ChatView.tsx` |
| Memory | Facts, graph, markdown view, search, and per-bot workspace shadow profile for every provider | `engine/server/memory.py`, `src/components/MemoryPanel.tsx` |
| Routines | Cron and manual runs for every selected driver; engine-backed routines also expose webhook controls; CLI routines show their execution limits | `server/routines.ts`, `engine/server/app.py`, `src/components/RoutinesPanel.tsx` |
| Skills | Shared list, enable, edit, delete, and teach-a-task flow; teaching requires a browser-capable profile | `engine/server/app.py`, `src/components/SkillsPanel.tsx` |
| Groups | Create from the top `+` menu, select bots, open a shared room; selected CLI bots use durable engine shadow ids for group transport | `src/components/Sidebar.tsx`, `src/components/GroupPanel.tsx`, `engine/server/groups.py` |
| Computers | One persistent browser per bot plus one shared browser profile; live preview, navigation, input takeover, screenshots, and explicit busy handling | `engine/server/computer.py`, `src/components/ComputerPanel.tsx` |
| Approvals | Allow/deny cards, per-bot permissions, tool allowlists, attention state for login/CAPTCHA questions | `engine/server/approvals.py`, `src/components/OptionCard.tsx` |
| Integrations | MCP servers, Composio connector catalog, per-bot connector settings, plugin install/account state | `server/mcp-*.ts`, `server/composio.ts`, `src/components/PluginsPanel.tsx` |
| Voice | Browser dictation on a secure context; native macOS speech helper in the desktop shell; optional engine TTS | `src/components/Composer.tsx`, `electron/speech.mjs` |
| Onboarding | Device scan, optional 24/7 provisioning with live progress, profile import, CLI detection/install, custom model setup, Electron permissions | `src/components/Onboarding.tsx`, `server/device.ts`, `server/setup-jobs.ts` |
| Remote access | Bearer-token auth for HTTP and WebSocket upgrades, token rotation, one-origin static/PWA hosting, loopback-only engine | `server/auth.ts`, `server/index.ts`, `public/manifest.webmanifest` |
| Installers | Windows per-user startup task, Linux systemd user service, Docker, and Android/Termux service | `scripts/install-server-windows.mjs`, `scripts/install-linux.sh`, `scripts/install-termux.sh` |
| PWA | Installable shell, cached static assets, network-only API/SSE data, mobile layout, token persistence | `public/manifest.webmanifest`, `public/sw.js`, `src/styles.css` |

## Provider semantics

`slafy` is an internal driver id for the embedded engine. It is not a product
name shown to users. A custom model is a named instance using that driver; the
engine receives `provider=custom`, `base_url`, and `model` at turn start.

CLI bots keep their native driver. Memory and Skills use a provider-neutral
workspace shadow profile, so they are available from the same bot header while
the provider conversation remains native. Routines are harness-owned and work
across drivers. Bot-to-bot delegation is always enabled: MCP-capable providers
get live peer tools; Codex/API providers use explicit `@bot` delegation and
receive the peer reply in their prompt.

## Platform matrix

| Platform | Chat/PWA | Engine memory/routines/skills | Browser computer | Always-on mode |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Windows | yes | yes | yes | per-user packaged task |
| macOS | yes | yes | yes | desktop/server mode |
| Linux/VPS | yes | yes | yes, headless by default | systemd user service or Docker |
| Android/Termux | yes | yes | no Playwright browser | `termux-services` + Termux:Boot |

## Known limits

- The engine remains bound to loopback. Remote access goes through the
  authenticated harness; use HTTPS/Tailscale for full PWA and microphone
  support.
- A group currently uses the shared engine room transport. A CLI participant is
  represented by a durable engine shadow; native mixed-driver group turns are a
  separate follow-up.
- Termux omits browser MCP dependencies because Android has no Playwright path;
  chat, workspace memory, routines, and skills remain available.
- Native iOS/Android store apps, OAuth for arbitrary MCP servers, and automatic
  Windows updates are intentionally outside this release.

## Verification

```sh
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
node scripts/selfhost-check.mjs
cd engine && .venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest -q
```
